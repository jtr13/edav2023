This webpage contains community contributions for Fall 2023 EDAV class at Columbia University.

There are 108 videos in total that are divided into 7 categories.

For the final project project, you’re welcome to first check out “[1. Data Collection and Preprocessing](https://jtr13.github.io/edav2023/project1.html)” and “[2. Data Visualization Techniques](https://jtr13.github.io/edav2023/project2.html)”, as these are all videos about the basic graphs, skills, and packages in R that are within the scope of the final project. There are also several subcategories in it.

Other categories cover more advanced skills, which may not necessarily be within the scope of the final project, but are still extremely interesting, useful, and insightful!
